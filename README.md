# Wanderlust

## CS50 Final Project

Wanderlust is a personal travel journal — using 9 years of data from my Untappd account — to savour memories from past trips.

Once upon a time, back in the days of a pre-pandemic world, I had the privilege of enjoying a lot of travel. My idea for [CS50 Final Project](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/project/) is to leverage my interest in traveling — and in this way make sure that I really do “create something that outlives this course” — because this is likely something I will continue to work on also after submitting this project.

I have registered beers on Untappd since 2013. I do like beer, but most of all, this application just happens to also be a rich source of data on where in the world I have been the past decade.

The main feature of the official Untappd service is a feed of what your friends are drinking. In addition to that, if you have a paid account, you can also access personal statistics. But those are focused on beers and breweries, which badges you have earned, your highest rated beers, and most frequently visited venues. I can for example see a list of top 5 countries, but those are country of origin for beers I have had — not countries where I have checked in. The content I am looking is different from what the official application (and their business model) revolve around. I want to figure out how to present different data — for me personally — focusing less on the beers and more on places I have visited.
